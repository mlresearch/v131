title: Seed-Programmed Autonomous General Learning
abstract: 'The knowledge that a natural learner creates of any new situation will
  initially not only be partial but very likely be partially incorrect. To improve
  incomplete and incorrect knowl- edge with increased experience – accumulated evidence
  – learning processes must bring already-acquired knowledge towards making sense
  of new situations. For the initial creation of knowledge, and its subsequent usage,
  expansion, modification, unification, and deletion, knowledge construction mechanisms
  must be self-guided, capable of self-supervised “sur- gical” operation on existing
  knowledge, involving among other things self-inspection or reflection. Further,
  the information that makes up an agent’s knowledge set must thus be structured in
  a way that supports reflective processes including discrimination, compari- son,
  and manipulation of arbitrary subsets of the knowledge set. Few proposals for how
  to achieve this in a parsimonious way exist. Here we present a theory of how systems
  with these properties may work, and how cumulative self-supervised learning mechanisms
  can reach levels of autonomy like those seen in individuals of many animal species.
  Our theory rests on the hypotheses that learning is (a) organized around causal
  relations, (b) boot- strapped from observed correlations, using (c) fine-grain relational
  models, manipulated by (d) micro-ampliative reasoning processes. We further hypothesize
  that a machine properly constructed in this way will be (e) capable of seed-programmed
  autonomous generality: The ability to apply learning to any phenomenon – that is,
  being domain-independent – provided that (f) the seed reference observable variables
  at “birth”, and that (g) new phenomena and existing knowledge overlap on one or
  more observables or inferred features. The theory is based on implemented systems
  that have produced notable results in the direction of increased general machine
  intelligence.'
