title: 'Self-Supervised Learning for Multi-Goal Grid World: Comparing Leela and Deep
  Q Network'
abstract: Modern machine learning research has explored numerous approaches to solving
  reinforce- ment learning with multiple goals and sparse rewards as well as learning
  correct actions from a small number of exploratory samples. We explore the ability
  of a self-supervised system which automatically creates and tests symbolic hypotheses
  about the world to ad- dress these same issues. Leela is a system which builds an
  understanding of the world using constructivist artificial intelligence. For our
  study, we create an N ∗ N grid world with goals related to proprioceptive or visual
  positions for exploration. We compare Leela to a DQN which includes hindsight for
  improving multigoal learning with sparse rewards. Our results show that Leela is
  able to learn to solve multigoal problems in an N ∗ N world with approximately 160N2
  exploratory steps compared to 360N2.7 steps required by the DQN.
