title: Continuous Learning of Action and State Spaces (CLASS)
abstract: 'We present a novel approach to state space discretization for constructivist
  and reinforcement learning. Constructivist learning and reinforcement learning often
  operate on a predefined set of states and transitions (state space). AI researchers
  design algorithms to reach particular goal states in this state space (for example,
  visualized in the form of goal cells that a robot should reach in a grid). When
  the size and the dimensionality of the state space increases, however, finding goal
  states becomes intractable. It is nonetheless assumed that these algorithms can
  have useful applications in the physical world provided that there is a way to construct
  a discrete state space of reasonable size and dimensionality. Yet, the manner in
  which the state space is discretized is the source of many problems for both constructivist
  and reinforcement learning approaches. The problems can roughly be divided into
  two categories: (1) wiring too much domain information into the solution, and (2)
  requiring massive storage to represent the state space (such as Q-tables. The problems
  relate to (1) the non generality arising from wiring domain information into the
  solution, and (2) non scalability of the approach to useful domains involving high
  dimensional state spaces. Another important limitation is that high dimensional
  state spaces require a massive number of learning trials. We present a new approach
  that builds upon ideas from place cells and cognitive maps.'
