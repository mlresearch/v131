title: IWSSL Introduction to this volume
abstract: This collection of papers was presented at the first annual international
  workshop on self- supervised learning (IWSSL2020) held in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
  between February 27 and February 28, 2020. They represent the state of the art in
  an expanding field of research that attempts to build systems that can learn without
  human intervention with little or no hard-wired domain knowledge, as would a new-born
  child or animal.
