title: Generating Natural Behaviors using Constructivist Algorithms
abstract: We present a project to design interactive devices (smart displays, robots,
  etc.) capable of self-motivated learning through non-goal-directed interactive behaviors
  (e.g., curious, emotional, playful behaviors). We use and improve algorithms inspired
  by constructivist epistemology that we have designed previously. These algorithms
  incrementally learn se- quential hierarchies of control loops in a bottom-up and
  open-ended fashion, and continu- ously reuse the learned higher-level control loops
  to generate increasingly complex behaviors that exhibit self-motivation. This project
  contributes to research in self-supervised learning because the learning is driven
  by low-level preferences that under-determine the deviceâ€™s fu- ture behaviors, leaving
  room for individuation, which, in turn, opens the way to autonomy in learning.
