title: Primitive-Decomposed Cognitive Representations Enhancing Learning with Primitive-Decomposed
  Cognitive Representations
abstract: This paper proposes work that applies insights from meaning representation
  systems for in-depth natural language understanding to representations for self-supervised
  learning systems, which show promise in developing complex, deeply-nested symbolic
  structures through self-motivated exploration of their environments. The core of
  the representation system transforms language inputs into language-free structures
  that are complex combinations of conceptual primitives, forming a substrate for
  human-like understanding and common-sense reasoning. We focus on decomposing representations
  of expectation, intention, planning, and decision-making which are essential to
  a self-motivated learner. These meaning representations may enhance learning by
  enabling a rich array of mappings between new experiences and structures stored
  in short-term and long-term memory. We also argue that learning can be further enhanced
  when language interaction itself is an integral part of the environment in which
  the self-supervised learning agent is embedded.
